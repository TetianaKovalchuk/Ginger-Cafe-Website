# Ginger-Cafe-Website
A website of a café.
I fully designed it myself, and I'm very proud of the website's design. It's a one-page website, its design idea is to contain all the pages (About us, Products, Contact us) as sections. It's, actually, a real café existing in Ukraine. I even was there. I liked it, so I took it as a reference for this website (I didn't create this website for this café, they didn't pay me for it). There is also a dark theme, it changes due to the time on the user's device. I made this with JavaScript, that's my first experience using time in scripts, so I'm especially proud of that. The link attached is a GitHub Pages link, and it doesn't show the scripts and some of the assets, so please watch the presentation video attached.
